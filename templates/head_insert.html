This is a replacement for the default HTML that pywb injects at the top of
proxied pages.

The default `head_insert.html` template adds the "wombat" JavaScript rewriting
code, which does client-side rewriting of dynamically created elements and XHR
requests to route them through the proxy.

Hypothesis is trying to avoid that as it slows down the page load considerably
and adds a lot of other resources.
